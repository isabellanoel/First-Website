In order to travel, one must first get an idea of their financial situation and then proceed.

   <h2>What are the benefit of traveling?</h2>
    
   <p>There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The first one being, we get to meet new people. When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends. Travelling also makes it easier to understand people. You will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more. When you get out of your comfort zone, you will become more sensitive towards other cultures and the people.</p>
    
   <p>Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills. For example, when you go to hilly areas, you will most likely trek and thus, trekking will be a new skill added to your list. Similarly, scuba diving or more can also be learned while travelling. A very important thing which travelling teaches us is to enjoy nature. It helps us appreciate the true beauty of the earth.</p>
